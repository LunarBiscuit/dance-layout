# Lunar's FastShell

Inspired by [FireShell](http://getfireshell.com)
Fiercely quick front-end boilerplate and workflows.

The opinionated FastShell framework. Built for the modern developer. For teams and the individual, encouraging a better workflow. JavaScript task running, build processes, autominification and file concatenation, wrapped with an enhanced HTML5 boilerplated framework.

Part of the Lunarplates suite:
* fastshell fork - for websites that don't require MVC or app structure.
* Angular2 Seed - Typescript and Angular2 boilerplate project (coming soon, possibly based on John papa's work)
* Angular1 Seed - For basic Angular Applications (coming soon)
